# Project: Soccer & Europe
In this project, we are going to explore, analyse, and visualize the nitty-gritty of the Soccer scence in Europe. Ofcourse, it would be anyones dream to predict the next league champion based on previous years data. Let's start small and understand the dataset before going any further with the predictions i.e., machine learning comes into picture.

## Requirements
|- Python3.x
|    - sqlite3
|    - folium
|    - pandas
|    - matplotlib
|    - seaborn 
|    - os

Some or most of the above libraries do not come pre-installed with Python3.x. Feel free to use `pip` and install libraries as required. Here is an example. 
```shell
pip install --user library_name
```

## Details
I have no clue as of now on how far I would go with this project. Let me just list of all the stages that I have planned so far.

`Gathering Data`
- [x] `Manually` download soccer data dataset from Kaggle
- [ ] `Programatically` download additional (e.g: soccer team logos) data using the power of Internet.
- [ ] 

`Assessing Data`
- [ ] Document data `Quality` issues
- [ ] Document data `Tidiness` issues

`Cleaning Data`
- [ ] Create a `quality-tidy` dataset
- [ ] Save as a new cleaned dataset

`Exploratory Data Analysis`
- [ ]

`Explanatory Data Analysis`
- [ ]

`Interactive StoryBoard`
- Planned - TO DO -

`Machine Learning for prediction`
- Planned - TO DO -
